# PingTool
Simple Ping Tool

This is an experimental project to see how complex and how well the Free Research Preview of ChatGPT-3.5 can create a program. The original Idea was to have it write a simple script file that takes two IP addresses and pings them concurrently 200 times with the windows native ping tool in command line. After a few iterations it was clear this was not only possible but easily achievable so a GUI was added to push the project further and make the tool more user friendly. As of Beta v1.0 the Ping Tool is functional but still needs improvements.
